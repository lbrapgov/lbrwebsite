                            <td>	The system of employing contract labour is prevalent in most industries in different occupations including skilled and semi skilled jobs. It is also prevalent in agricultural and allied operations and to some extent in the services sector. A workman is deemed to be employed as Contract Labour when he is hired in connection with the work of an establishment by or through a contractor. Contract workmen are indirect employees; persons who are hired, supervised and remunerated by a contractor who, in turn, is compensated by the establishment. Contract labour has to be employed for work which is specific and for definite duration. Inferior labour status, casual nature of employment, lack of job security and poor economic conditions are the major characteristics of contract labour. While economic factors like cost effectiveness may justify system of contract labour, considerations of social justice call for its abolition or regulation.  The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 was brought to regulate the employment of Contract Labour in certain establishments and to provide for its abolition in certain circumstances and for matters connected therewith. 

                                The Act applies in the State to every establishment in which 5 or more workers are employed on any day of the preceding 12 months as contract labour.
                                
                                During the year 2003 an amendment has carried out in section 2(i) of the act by inserting a clause (dd) that no contract labour shall be employed in core activities of the establishment in Andhra Pradesh.  Any activity for which the establishment is set up and includes any activity which is essential or necessary is a core activity. The activities like watch and ward, sanitation, Canteen, gardening, Running hospital, cleaning works etc were not included as core activity of the establishment.

                            The Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is a Central legislation aimed at statutory fixation of minimum rates of wages in the employments wherein sweated labour is not prevalent or where there is chance for exploitation of unorganized labour. The provisions of the Act are intended to achieve the object of doing social justice to workmen employed in the scheduled employments by prescribing minimum rates of wages for them.  The legislative policy, which is apparent on the face of the enactment itself, is the statutory fixation of minimum wages with a view to obviate the chances of exploitation of labour.  
                            The Act provides for fixation/revision of minimum rates of wages in the scheduled employment notified under the Act. The Government of Andhra Pradesh have fixed minimum rates of wages in (71) Scheduled employments so far under Minimum Wages Act, 1948.  In which 63 employments (Non Agricultural related) are covered under part-I and 8 (Agricultural related) Scheduled employments under part-II of the said Act.   Presently, the wages have been fixed to each and every category under the above specific employments and resultantly the wages are fixed covering nearly for 20 to 40 categories of workers in each employment, creating confusion among the working class about their wages. Due to plenty of Scheduled Employments much time is being consumed for revision without uniformity and causing discrimination of wages among the workers.  It is becoming very difficult to the Inspectors notified under the Act in implementation of wages due to innumerable schedules.  Moreover, in the existing G.Os, there is a variation in wages from employment to employment for similar category of worker.  Because of variation in wages to similar categories of workers in the employment to employment, leads to anomalies among the workers doing same and similar type of work. 
                            In the present days most of the employers are engaging the workers through Outsourcing Agencies.  The workers appointed through contractor are being allotted to various establishments in similar categories.  Due to variation in wages to similar category of worker in the employment–to-employment, leads to disparity among the regular and contract workers. 
                            To overcome this problem, it is considered necessary to simplify and rationalize the existing Scheduled employments under the Act and to fix uniform rates to the similar category to workers and simultaneously reduce the categories as well as employments, the Government The Government through  G.O.Rt.No.654, dated 18/05/2010 of Labour, Employment, Training and Factories (Lab.II) Department,  have constituted the Rationalization Committee for Simplification and Rationalization of the schedule of Employments under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, with a term of 2 years period to ensure that the implementation of the Government orders issued based on the recommendations the Committee can be evaluated.    The recommendation of the Committee is under progress.
                                During the year 1989, Government of Andhra Pradesh have introduced for the first time the Cost of Living Allowance in addition to the notified basic wage in respect of the scheduled Employments covered under Part-I of the schedule.   The Commissioner of Labour notifies the increase of average Consumer Price Index Numbers o n 1st April and 1st October every year taking into account the CPI numbers of both Central and State series from 12 centers for the half year ending June & December.   
                            Recently the Government took a decision to implement the Variable Dearness Allowance component to the scheduled employments covered under Part-II of the Schedule under Minimum Wages Act on par with the scheduled employments covered under Part-I.
                            The process of revision of minimum rates of wages in the respective Scheduled Employments is being taken up for every 5 years against the Scheduled Employments where the VDA component is a part of wages and for every two years where the VDA is not applicable.  
                            The Government of India vide letter No.P-11012/1/2009-WC (MW), dated 8th February, 2010 of the Deputy Director General, Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India, New Delhi has informed to fix the minimum wages not below the National Floor Level minimum wages of Rs.100/- per day in all the scheduled employments.  The Hon’ble Union Minister for Labour & Employment, Government of India has requested the Hon’ble Chief Minister in his D.O.Letter to take necessary steps for fixation/revision of the minimum rates of wages in respect of all scheduled employments in Andhra Pradesh not below the National Floor Level Minimum wage of Rs.115/- per day w.e.f. 1.4.2011.   In view of this, the wage level reached on par with National Floor Level in all scheduled employments notified by the Government.
                                The Government of Andhra Pradesh appointed Assistant Labour Officers, Asst. Commissioners of Labour, Deputy Commissioners of Labour and Joint Commissioners of Labour as Inspectors under Section-19 in their respective jurisdictions.</td>
                            <td>Section 5 deals with procedure for fixing and revising minimum wages with the advice of members of Advisory Board.  
                                Under Section 19 of the Act Inspectors are notified.  Powers are vested with them to file the claims for non payment of minimum wages. 
                                Under Section 20 claim authorities are notified.
                                The Commissioner of Labour is the authority to declare the variable dearness allowance on the 1st April and 1st October every year based on the consumer price index.

                                As regards, opening and closing hours, weekly off and National, Festival and Other Holidays, the Act provides different conditions for Shops & Establishments.
                                Section 7(1) of the Act provides for fixing of opening & closing hours in respect of Shops and the Government notified different Opening and Closing hours for various categories of Shops. The Opening & Closing Hours applicable to General category of Shops are 8.30 am and 8.30 pm.  Section 12(1) stipulates that all shops shall be closed on every Sunday.  The conditions related to Shops are provided under Chapter III. Section 31(1) provides for 9 National and Festival Holidays to all employees in shops and Establishments.
                                The conditions in respect of “Establishments other than shops” are laid down under Chapter – IV.  Section 15 speaks about opening and closing hours to be fixed for different categories of establishments and compared to the hours applicable to shops, opening and closing hours of establishments other than shops are fixed so that they have more number of hours to transact their business. For hotels the opening and closing hours are 5.00 AM to 10.00 pm and for Cinema Theatres 8.30am to 1.30 am. Section 19 requires that every employee in any establishment other than a shop shall be allowed a whole day as holiday in each week. The National, Festival and Other Holidays provided u/s 31(1) are commonly applicable to all establishments including Shops.
                                The Act provides for different opening and closing hours and different conditions as regards weekly off and festival holidays for “Shops” and “Establishments other than Shops” . The General exemptions granted to certain Shops under 73(4) of the Act do away with the differential conditions applicable to “Shops” and “Establishments other than shops”. The Act provides for more flexible conditions as regards opening and Closing hours and weekly offs in respect of Establishments other than shops, perhaps in public interest since the goods and services available in these establishments are more essential like Medicines, Food, fuel etc,.
