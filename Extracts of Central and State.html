                                    <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

Section 2-a(i) vests exclusive jurisdiction in the Central Government in relation to Industrial dispute arising from employment in various sectors mentioned therein including Controlled Industry. Thus, in so far as cement industry is concerned, Central Government is the appropriate Government which is competent to deal with the matters arising out of Industrial Disputes Act. However, section 39 of the Act vests residuary power in the Central Government to delegate the powers vested in the Central Government to the State Governments by way of a General or Special Order with reference to the controlled industry or other industries mentioned therein. In exercise of such power Central Government issued notification in S.O.826(E) dated 08.11.1977 published in the Gazette on 08.12.1977 delegating power to State Government with reference to Cement industry. By virtue of this notification the power as exercisable by the Central Government under Section 2(a)(i) is now vested in the State Government in so far as cement industry is concerned.</p></td>
